# Introduction to Python for Machine Learning

Hello and welcome to the `Introduction to Python for Machine Learning` course!

## What is this course about?
This course is about learning the basics of Python for Machine Learning. 
Machine Learning as well as Data Analysis is a very interdisciplinary field, that moves from knowing some basics and tools of computer engineering, to statistical techniques to deal with complex datasets, to mathematical algorithms to solve the problems, to write usefull reports with their corresponding plots.

This course tries to show you the basics of that, so it will be an interdisciplinary course where you will learn the basics to start your own path as a user of Machine Learning and Python.
